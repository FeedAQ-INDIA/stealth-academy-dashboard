  ]
}
```

## Component Props

The component uses React Router's `useOutletContext()` to access:

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `courseList` | Object | Current course information |
| `members` | Array | List of course room members |
| `isLoading` | Boolean | Loading state from parent context |

## State Management

### Local State Variables
- `isLoading`: Loading state for progress data
- `progressData`: Array of enriched member data with progress
- `selectedMember`: Currently selected member for detailed view
- `viewMode`: Display mode ("overview" or "detailed")

## Data Flow

1. **Mount**: Component fetches progress for all members on mount
2. **API Calls**: Makes parallel requests to `/user-progress/{courseId}/{userId}` for each member
3. **Data Enrichment**: Combines member data with progress/enrollment data
4. **Statistics Calculation**: Computes overall stats, leaderboard, and insights
5. **Render**: Displays all information with responsive UI

## Usage Example

```jsx
import CourseRoomProgress from '@/components-xm/Course/CourseRoom/CourseRoomProgress';

// In your router configuration
<Route path="progress" element={<CourseRoomProgress />} />
```

## UI Components Used

- **Card**: Container for sections
- **Badge**: Status indicators
- **Avatar**: User profile pictures
- **Progress**: Visual progress bars
- **Button**: Interactive elements
- **Skeleton**: Loading states
- **Alert**: Warning/info messages

## Enrollment Status Types

| Status | Icon | Color | Description |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| `ENROLLED` | üìñ BookOpen | Blue | User enrolled but not started |
| `IN_PROGRESS` | ‚ñ∂Ô∏è PlayCircle | Yellow | User actively learning |
| `COMPLETED` | ‚úÖ CheckCircle | Green | User finished all content |
| `CERTIFIED` | üèÜ Award | Purple | User received certificate |

## Progress Status Types

| Status | Icon | Color | Description |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| `NOT_STARTED` | - | Gray | Content not accessed |
| `IN_PROGRESS` | ‚ñ∂Ô∏è | Yellow | Content partially completed |
| `COMPLETED` | ‚úÖ | Green | Content fully completed |
| `LOCKED` | üîí | Red | Content not accessible |

## Styling

- Uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- Follows **Shadcn/ui** component library conventions
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Gradient backgrounds for visual hierarchy
- Smooth transitions and hover effects

## Performance Optimizations

1. **useMemo**: Memoizes calculated statistics and leaderboard
2. **Parallel API Calls**: Fetches all user progress simultaneously
3. **Conditional Rendering**: Only shows detailed view when expanded
4. **Lazy Loading**: Scrollable activity logs with max height

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast compliance
- Screen reader friendly

## Error Handling

- Try-catch blocks for all API calls
- Toast notifications for errors
- Fallback UI for empty states
- Loading skeletons during data fetch

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Export progress data to CSV/PDF
- [ ] Filter by enrollment status
- [ ] Date range filtering for activities
- [ ] Real-time progress updates via WebSocket
- [ ] Comparison view between members
- [ ] Email reports to instructors
- [ ] Custom progress milestones
- [ ] Integration with analytics platforms

}
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Load component with enrolled members
- [ ] Load component with empty member list
- [ ] Expand/collapse detailed view for each member
- [ ] Verify leaderboard ranking accuracy
- [ ] Check progress percentage calculations
- [ ] Test with different enrollment statuses
- [ ] Verify responsive behavior on mobile
- [ ] Test error handling with network issues

### Test Scenarios
1. **No Members**: Should display empty state message
2. **All Completed**: Should show 100% completion rate
3. **Mixed Progress**: Should accurately calculate averages
4. **No Enrollment**: Should show "not enrolled" alert
5. **Loading State**: Should display skeletons

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Progress not loading
- **Solution**: Check API endpoint `/user-progress/{courseId}/{userId}` is accessible
- Verify user permissions to view progress data

**Issue**: Incorrect progress percentages
- **Solution**: Ensure activity logs have correct `progressStatus` values
- Check calculation logic in `overallStats` useMemo

**Issue**: Members not showing
- **Solution**: Verify `members` prop from parent context is populated
- Check course room membership API

## Support

- Check console for error messages
- Review network tab for failed API calls
- Consult backend API documentation
