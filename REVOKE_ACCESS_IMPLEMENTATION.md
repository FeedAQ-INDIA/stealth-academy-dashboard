# Revoke Access Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a secure revoke access functionality for course room members with a type-to-confirm verification dialog.

## Implementation Date
October 19, 2025

## Features Implemented

### 1. RevokeAccessDialog Component
**File**: `src/components-xm/Course/components/RevokeAccessDialog.jsx`

A confirmation dialog that requires users to type "REVOKE" to confirm the action.

**Key Features:**
- Type-to-confirm verification (user must type "REVOKE")
- Visual warning indicators with AlertTriangle icon
- Clear explanation of consequences
- Disabled confirm button until verification text matches
- Auto-reset on close

**Props:**
- `open`: Boolean - Controls dialog visibility
- `onOpenChange`: Function - Handles dialog state changes
- `member`: Object - Member data to be revoked
- `onConfirm`: Function - Callback when revoke is confirmed

### 2. MembersTable Component Updates
**File**: `src/components-xm/Course/components/MembersTable.jsx`

Added "Revoke" button to member actions.

**Changes:**
- Added `UserMinus` icon import
- Added `onRevokeAccess` prop
- Added "Revoke" button with red styling
- Only shows revoke button for non-owner members
- Only visible to course owners and admins

**Button Features:**
- Red color scheme to indicate danger
- Only visible to authorized users (owner/admin)
- Hidden for course owner (cannot revoke own access)

### 3. useCourseRoomMembers Hook Enhancement
**File**: `src/hooks/useCourseRoomMembers.js`

Added `revokeAccess` function to handle API calls.

**New Function:**
```javascript
revokeAccess(member)
```

**Functionality:**
- Validates member data (checks for `courseAccessId`)
- Calls `courseRoomService.removeMemberFromCourseRoom()`
- Shows success/error toast notifications
- Auto-refreshes member list after successful revocation
- Handles errors gracefully

### 4. CourseRoomMembers Component Updates
**File**: `src/components-xm/Course/CourseRoomMembers.jsx`

Integrated revoke access workflow.

**Changes:**
- Added `RevokeAccessDialog` import
- Added `revokeDialogOpen` state
- Destructured `revokeAccess` from hook
- Added `handleRevokeAccess` - Opens dialog with selected member
- Added `handleConfirmRevoke` - Executes revoke and closes dialog
- Passed `onRevokeAccess` prop to `MembersTable`
- Rendered `RevokeAccessDialog` component

## Backend API
The implementation uses the existing backend API:

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/courseAccess/revokeAccess`

**Required Data:**
```javascript
{
  courseAccessId: string
}
```

**Controller**: `src/controller/CourseAccess.controller.js`
**Service**: `src/service/CourseAccess.service.js`

## User Flow

1. **Course Owner/Admin** views the members list
2. Clicks the **"Revoke"** button next to a member
3. **RevokeAccessDialog** opens showing:
   - Member name/email
   - Warning about consequences
   - List of what the member will lose
   - Input field for typing "REVOKE"
4. User types **"REVOKE"** (case-insensitive)
5. **"Revoke Access"** button becomes enabled
6. User clicks **"Revoke Access"**
7. API call is made to revoke access
8. Success toast notification appears
9. Member list refreshes automatically
10. Dialog closes

## Security Features

### Permission Checks
- Only course owners and admins can revoke access
- Course owner cannot revoke their own access
- Backend validates permissions server-side

### Confirmation Requirements
- User must type "REVOKE" exactly (case-insensitive)
- Confirm button is disabled until verification
- Clear visual warnings about action consequences

### Error Handling
- Validates `courseAccessId` before API call
- Catches and displays API errors
- Graceful degradation on failures
- Toast notifications for all outcomes

## UI/UX Considerations

### Visual Design
- Red color scheme for danger indication
- Alert triangle icon for warnings
- Clear button states (enabled/disabled)
- Consistent styling with existing UI

### User Feedback
- Toast notifications for success/failure
- Detailed error messages
- Automatic list refresh after action
- Clear consequence explanations

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management
- Screen reader friendly

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Test as course owner
2. Test as admin member
3. Test as regular member (should not see button)
4. Test revoking different member types
5. Test typing incorrect confirmation text
6. Test typing correct confirmation text
7. Test cancel action
8. Test with network errors

### Edge Cases
- Revoke access while member is active
- Revoke access for invited but not joined users
- Revoke access with expired sessions
- Concurrent revocation attempts

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bulk Revoke**: Select multiple members to revoke at once
2. **Revoke History**: Log of all revoked members
3. **Undo Revoke**: Option to restore access within time window
4. **Email Notification**: Notify member when access is revoked
5. **Custom Confirmation Text**: Admin configurable verification word
6. **Soft Delete**: Archive instead of permanent removal
7. **Revoke Reasons**: Require/allow reason for revocation
8. **Audit Trail**: Track who revoked and when
