### Code Quality
- ✅ **Added PropTypes** for type checking
- ✅ **Consistent error handling** across components
- ✅ **Improved accessibility** with proper ARIA labels
- ✅ **Enhanced keyboard navigation** support

### Architecture Improvements
- ✅ **Separated concerns** - each component has a clear responsibility
- ✅ **Standardized prop interfaces** across components
- ✅ **Improved maintainability** with better code organization

## API Integration

The components integrate with the following API endpoints:

```javascript
// Create course from URLs
POST /createOrUpdateCourseBuilder

// Get course builder data
GET /courseBuilder/:courseBuilderId

// Update course builder
PUT /courseBuilder/:courseBuilderId
```

## Content Types Supported

1. **CourseVideo** - YouTube videos and video content
2. **CourseWritten** - Articles, documents, written material  
3. **CourseQuiz** - Interactive quizzes and assessments
4. **CourseFlashcard** - Flashcard sets for memorization
5. **CourseAssignment** - Homework and assignment tasks

## Usage Example

```jsx
import Builder from '@/components-xm/CourseBuilder/Builder';
import PreviewBuilder from '@/components-xm/CourseBuilder/PreviewBuilder';

// For course creation
function CreateCourse() {
  return <Builder />;
}

// For course editing/preview
function EditCourse() {
  return <PreviewBuilder />;
}
```
